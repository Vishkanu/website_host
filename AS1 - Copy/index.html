        <p class="main_text">My name is Michael and I would like to introduce you to the purpose of this website.
            This website will display both my ability to create it and to display my future projects and other work.</p>
        <h2 class="index_title">Exploring the Pages of this Website</h2>
        <P class="main_text">The pages of this website will be consisting of different pieces of content, each specific
            to their own requirements. I'm hoping this page will prove my ability in creating one that meets the correct
            standard.</P>

        <section class="image_container">
            <img src="explore_the_page.jpg" alt="Explore the page like an astronaut">
        </section>

        <h3>Home Page:</h3>
        <p class="main_text">This is the page you are currently looking at and (as will be shown below) it contains
            information on what each of the pages will consist of.</p>
        <h3>Portfolio Page:</h3>
        <p class="main_text">This page will display my ability by showing the projects I have undertaken in my
            experience here at University. It should allow any person viewing it to see my level of understanding at
            that given time. These will be updated as I complete more projects in my second year but for now will
            display placeholder text and images.</p>
        <h3>Contact:</h3>
        <p class="main_text">The contact page will display my contact information and a form in which I can be
            contacted. I'm hoping that this will display my ability to embed a form into a page as well as allow any
            feedback for my website to be delivered to me by users directly.</p>
        <h3>Experience:</h3>
        <p class="main_text"> This page will cover any and all experience I have working in or for companies. This page
            will contain
            placeholder text and images if no such experience appears as of yet.</p>
        <h3>Site Report:</h3>
        <p class="main_text">The site report is the page in which you will find the report written after I created all
            other parts of this website. You will see a reflective account of my experiences on this module as well as
            screenshots confirming my HTML and CSS is valid.</p>
    </main>
    <aside>
        <p class="aside_index">Thank you for visiting my website!</p>
        <p class="aside_index">I hope you find the information easy to access and understand. I would love it if you
            could give me feedback!</p>
        <p class="aside_index">If you are wanting to get into contact, please use my contact information or the form
            found on the contact page. This is explained a tad further on the left.</p>
