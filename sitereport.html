        <h2>Reflecting On Constructing The Website</h2>
        <p class="main_text">This website has been a fantastic opportunity for me to progress my knowledge with HTML and
            CSS. Things I have learnt have allowed me to construct this very website!</p>
        <p class="main_text">I have however faced many issues with making this website that highlighted key gaps in my
            knowledge. An example of this was adding the responsiveness to my website. I struggled with this greatly as
            going between CSS sheets was an issue that I had to get used to. When I originally started working on this
            website, I had one single style sheet so when I learnt of this responsive design I had to break this one
            style sheet into three. This took me a long amount of time to wrap my head around.</p>
        <p class="main_text">
            Something that took far less long and aided me greatly in creating this website is learning the shortcuts
            for visual studio code. This allowed me to write the HTML far quicker that I would have otherwise.
        </p>
        <h2>Design Choices</h2>
        <p class="main_text">Designing this website was incredibly easy as I was made aware of colour palette tools
            online. To create my colour palette I found an image of a starry night sky that I liked the look of. From
            this an online tool was able to give me a matching colour palette that is currently in use for this website.
        </p>
        <p class="main_text">Another design choice I had was with the aside. I wanted this to act as an easy to read
            description of the page as to not have it take up too much space. I feel this puts more emphasis on the left
            hand side of the page as many of the asides on my website refer to the text on the left.</p>
        <p class="main_text">I wanted my navbar to cover the top of the page because, in my experience, this is the most
            common and easiest to use. Having the navbar below the heading is something I tried but ended up disliking.
            I also wanted the navbar to react to the user hovering over each option to make it easier to determine which
            page you would be selecting. I did this by a slight change in colour. The navbar options also change colour
            in order to indicate which page is currently selected.</p>
